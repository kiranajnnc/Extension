                                      ## Interview Questions: Browser Extension Security

### 1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?
- Browser extensions can access sensitive information, monitor browsing activity, inject malicious scripts, or exploit browser vulnerabilities. Malicious extensions can steal data, track users, or serve ads without consent.

### 2. What permissions should raise suspicion?
- Permissions like access to all website data, clipboard, keystrokes, file system, and personal information should raise red flags. Excessive or irrelevant permissions for an extension’s stated functionality are a warning sign.

### 3. How to safely install browser extensions?
- Only install extensions from official web stores (such as Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons).
- Check reviews, download counts, developer credibility, and update frequency.
- Avoid installing too many extensions, especially from unknown developers.

### 4. What is extension sandboxing?
- Extension sandboxing isolates the extension’s code from accessing or affecting sensitive browser processes and user data directly. Sandboxing limits the potential damage of compromised or malicious extensions.

### 5. Can extensions steal passwords?
- Yes, extensions with permissions to access webpage data or content can potentially steal passwords if poorly coded or intentionally malicious.

### 6. How to update extensions securely?
- Use browsers that auto-update extensions from official stores.
- Avoid downloading or installing updates from third-party sites.
- Regularly check for updates and uninstall outdated or unsupported extensions.

### 7. Difference between extensions and plugins?
| Feature       | Extensions                                     | Plugins                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------- |------------------------------------|
| Purpose       | Enhance browser functionality                  | Enable content types (video, flash)|
| Scope         | Runs within browser’s environment              | Runs outside browser sandbox       |
| Installation  | From browser store                             | Separate download, external        |
| Example       | Ad blockers, password managers                 | Flash, Java                        |

### 8. How to report malicious extensions?
- Use the reporting feature in the browser’s extension/add-on store.
- Provide detailed information about malicious behavior.
- Disable and uninstall the extension immediately.
- Report to browser vendors’ security teams for faster action.
